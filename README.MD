# CSV Difference Finder

This Python script compares two CSV files and generates a new CSV file containing the differences between them. The script is compatible with Python 2.7.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7

## Usage

1. Save the script as `compare_csvs.py`.

2. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

3. Run the script with the following command:

`python compare_csvs.py <file1_path> <file2_path> [-o <output_file_path>]`

Replace `<file1_path>` and `<file2_path>` with the paths to your input CSV files. Optionally, provide the `-o` flag followed by `<output_file_path>` to specify a custom output file path. If the `-o` flag is not provided, the default output file name will be "differences.csv" in the current working directory.

## Example

Suppose you have two CSV files named `data_old.csv` and `data_new.csv`, and you want to find the differences between them and save the result as `differences.csv`. Run the following command:

`python compare_csvs.py data_old.csv data_new.csv -o differences.csv`

This command will compare the two input files and generate a new file named `differences.csv` containing the differences.

## Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

`python -m unittest test_compare_csvs`
